# Welcome!

## About Me
I am a computational biologist enthusiastic about extracting quantitative insight from complex biological data. My quantitative background is deeply rooted in my Ph.D training in biophysics at the University of Chicago. I now bridge quantitative principles and cancer biology as a postdoc in computational oncology at Washington University in St. Louis. Outside of work, I enjoy baseball and ballroom dancing.

## What I Do
My current research focuses on spatial biology and the integrative analysis of omics and imaging data in biomedical research. My work involves computational analysis of spatial transcriptomics, single-cell RNA-seq, and fluorescence microscopy datasets. Find out more about my technical skills and experiences in the [CV](cv.md) page.

## Recent Projects
I have worked on a few different projects that span diverse scales and biological domains, such as:

- Bone marrow microenvironment changes with aging and cancer
- 3D morphological changes from precancer to cancer
- Assembly mechanisms of myosin clusters in adherent cells
