# Projects

Here are a few projects that I've worked on so far.

## Aging and the Bone Marrow Microenvironment

My main postdoc project at the Washington University in St. Louis involves the molecular profiling of the human bone marrow. As part of the Cellular Senescence Network ([SenNet](https://sennetconsortium.org/)) supported by NIH, we build a multi-omic atlas of the aging human bone marrow microenvironment investigate the connection between immune aging and blood cancers. By integrating scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics datasets, we profile the molecular and structural changes in the bone marrow due to aging and cancer.

## 3D Morphological Changes in Cancer Progression

In this side project during my postdoc, we aim to understand the 3D tumor structure and microenvironment changes from precancerous lesions to invasive carcinoma. Complementing my colleagues' approach of reconstructing 3D volumes from serial 2D sections, I imaged whole tumor tissues (~10 mm^3^) using lightsheet microscopy. We visualized the whole tumor volume in 3D and quantitatively characterized the differences in pre-cancerous lesions and invasive carcinoma. [Learn more](Projects/precancer-cancer-3d.md)

## Myosin Cluster Assembly in Adherent Cells

During my Ph.D. at the University of Chicago, I study how the cell cytoskeleton build subcellular structures that produces mechanical forces. Combining advanced light microscopy, quantitative image analysis, and computational modeling, we reveal that myosin cluster formation is controlled by the limiting pool of myosin filaments and F-actin architecture.
